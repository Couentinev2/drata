Current State
-------------

The application currently uses keyword matching in:

  /api/chat/route.ts


INTEGRATION APPROACH
-------------------

1) Choose an LLM Provider

2) Update the API Route

Replace the existing keyword-matching logic with a call to the LLM provider.

Flow:
- Receive user's message
- Send the message + context to LLM API
- Receive LLM response
- Stream the response back to the client


3) Add Context and Prompting

- Define the assistant’s role
  (e.g., "You are a Drata compliance expert")

Context Injection:
- Include relevant domain knowledge
  (frameworks, compliance features, terminology)
- Optionally include recent conversation history for continuity


4) Streaming Responses

- Keep the existing streaming implementation in:
  
  AiAssistant.tsx

- The API route should stream tokens as they arrive from the LLM
  to provide a real-time chat experience
