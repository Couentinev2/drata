MARKETING & DESIGN COLLABORATION WORKFLOW
========================================

The AI Helper component is registered in Builder.io with configurable inputs.
This allows marketing and design teams to manage ongoing updates independently of engineering.

Typical collaboration flow:

1) Design Team
   - Defines layout and default styling of the AI Helper component
   - Exposes editable fields in Builder.io (title, colors, CTA, copy)

2) Marketing / Content Team
   - Updates messaging directly in Builder.io:
       * Welcome message
       * CTA text and destination
       * Campaign-specific color changes
   - Publishes or schedules changes instantly

3) Engineering Team
   - Owns the core component behavior and AI logic
   - Ensures stability, performance, and compliance
   - Only involved when new features or full redisign needed
