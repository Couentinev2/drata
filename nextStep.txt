## ANALYTICS
--------------------


We will add basic analytics to understand how people use the site and the AI assistant.

We want to monitor:

Visitors and page views

How often the AI assistant is opened and used

Which CTAs get clicked

Demo conversion rates

Site performance (Core Web Vitals)

Errors and crashes

This gives us real insight into what is working and what needs improvement.


## PRIVACY AND COMPLIANCE
--------------------


Before going live, we make sure everything is privacy-safe.

Key actions:

Add a cookie consent banner before loading analytics

Show a small privacy note in the AI assistant explaining that conversations are not stored

Publish a Privacy Policy explaining how data is handled

Support opt-out and data deletion requests (GDPR / CCPA friendly)

Important principle:

AI chats are processed in memory only and are not stored.


## RATE LIMITING (PROTECT THE AI ENDPOINT)
--------------------


We will protect the AI API from abuse and runaway costs.

Strategy:

Limit requests per IP (for example, around 10 per minute)

Limit requests per user session (for example, around 50 per hour)

If someone keeps hitting limits, automatically slow them down using exponential backoff

This keeps the system stable, fast, and affordable.
